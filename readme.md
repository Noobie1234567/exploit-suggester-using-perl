The code begins with the declaration of strict and warnings pragmas, which enforce coding best practices and help catch potential issues.

ANSI escape sequences are defined as variables to add color to the output.

The print_banner() function displays a banner at the start of the program.

The get_exploits() function defines a hash %exploits that contains information about various exploits. Each exploit is represented by a key, and its details (CVE, vulnerability, source, etc.) are stored as values.

The search_exploits() function takes the %exploits hash and a kernel version as parameters. It searches for exploits that match the given kernel version and returns an array of vulnerable exploits.

The is_vulnerable() function checks if there are any vulnerable exploits for a given kernel version by calling the search_exploits() function. It returns 1 if there are vulnerable exploits and 0 otherwise.

The print_results() function takes the %exploits hash and a kernel version as parameters. It calls the search_exploits() function to get the vulnerable exploits and prints the details of each exploit, including the exploit name, CVE, and source.

The download_exploits() function takes the %exploits hash and downloads the exploits from their respective sources using the wget command.

The parse_arguments() function parses the command-line arguments. It extracts the kernel version and download mode (if provided) from the command-line arguments.

The usage() function prints the usage instructions for running the script.

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It initializes variables, displays the banner, parses command-line arguments, retrieves the exploits, and either downloads the exploits or searches for vulnerabilities based on the provided arguments.

Finally, the main() function is called to start the execution of the script.
